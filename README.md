# geolocationtests

*Testing Google Maps API for a project that will require geolocation and testing relative differences.

*Surprising how much you can do with this API in just a few lines of code. The "watchPosition()" method is very powerful. I have found, however, that it does return a low-accuracy result at the start in exchange for a faster response.
